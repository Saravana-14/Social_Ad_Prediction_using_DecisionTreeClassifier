Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems.

It works by splitting data into branches based on feature conditions using entropy or Gini index.

The model is easy to understand and visualize like a tree structure.

It can handle both numerical and categorical data without much preprocessing.

Decision Trees are widely used in predictive modeling and form the base of Random Forests.
